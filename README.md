# Atmosphere

## Purpose 
An app that generates a music playlist based on the weather in a user's given local. The app will make use of Spotify's free API and the Weather API. Users will first enter a zipcode, a forecast for that day's weather will populate, users will then be asked to enter their Spotify login information, and then a playlist of music will generate with the theme of that weather forecast.
